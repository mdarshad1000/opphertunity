# Podium
This repository contains the web scraping code of Python using Beautiful Soup for our project **Podium**. This is a hackathon project for Hack Girl Summer 3 hackathon hosted by MLH.

## Inspiration ü•≥
A study found out that in 2020, women comprise only 28.8% of the tech workforce. While this has been a slight increase from what it was in 2018, we wanted to contribute to changing the same. This is how we came up with **Podium**.

## What it does üßë‚Äçüíª
- In many countries, women and non-binary groups struggle in tech and various opportunities emerging in today's world.

- **Podium** will stand beside them and provide them with opportunities and help them to get involved in various meetups, open source programs, content and many more activities happening in the world of tech. 

## How we built it ‚öíÔ∏è
- We used **Velo by Wix** to build our project. 

- Wix is a no-code tool and we tried our best to build our project idea realistic. 

-  We used different Wix apps to add to our website eg: added a `Login/SignUp` system with various badges like `seekers` `alumni` and `mentors`

- We have also used **Python**  to scrape some websites through `Beautiful-Soup` to get data regarding different opportunities and how we can help them to get into tech 

## Challenges we ran into ü§î
- Building a fun project is entertaining but it also comes with a lot of challenges.

- Wix was a new tool for all of us. We all together as a team had to learn about Wix before using it. 
Some of us were not able to edit templates and had to figure out solutions from the documentation and support sections. 

- We also faced some challenges while scraping data using Python and Beautiful soup.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of üòá
- We are proud of working as a team and building a project that lives up to our expectations.

- We're proud that after having so many challenges we finally came up with our project on Wix and also we got to learn about the new no-code tool and Beautiful soup. 

## What we learnedüìù
- We learned a lot this weekend and worked as a great team throughout the hackathon

- We read about a new no-code tool called **Velo by Wix** so we can use it in our future projects. We had to read about Velo's API referencing documentation that allowed us to connect databases to Wix sections. 

- We also got to figure out on how to write custom JavaScript logic using Velo's editor syntax.

- We also learned about web scraping using **Python** and **Beautiful Soup**

## What's next for PodiumüöÄ
We plan on taking our project to new heights by providing more features to make it more accessible. We will try to add a better chatting platform for our users and mentors to interact via our website.
